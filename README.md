## Abstract
In the field of medical imaging, the precise classification of high-dimensional, heterogeneous images is crucial for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing treatment strategies. Traditional methods often struggle due to significant overlap in high-dimensional feature spaces, focusing primarily on delineating optimal inter-class boundaries. To address these challenges, we introduce an Enhanced Contrastive Learning (ECL) strategy aimed at refining the distinction between various image categories by optimizing the embeddings within these complex spaces. Building upon this, our Attention-Enhanced Autoencoder Framework (MEAAC), which incorporates Multi-Scale Feature Extraction Blocks (MSFEB) and Channel Attention (CA) modules, is designed to unearth a broad spectrum of features from minute details to overarching structures in medical images, thereby enhancing the model's capacity for nuanced feature extraction. Concurrently, the CA module accentuates pivotal channel information, enriching the model's representational depth. Rigorously tested across various medical imaging applications, with tumor classification serving as a notable example, our framework demonstrates superiority over existing methodologies, particularly in enhancing classification accuracy and generalization across diverse medical imaging tasks. This suggests that our method could serve as a versatile tool in the nuanced field of medical image classification, setting new benchmarks for diagnostic precision and efficacy.
